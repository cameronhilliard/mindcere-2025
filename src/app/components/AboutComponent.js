        <p className='text-xl/10 px-6 text-center'>MindCere was born from my deep curiosity about brain health, sparked by my own experience with a seizure. That moment led me to explore ways to better understand and protect the brain. As a developer fascinated by this topic, I created MindCere to uncover insights that could help not only me but others who are also looking for ways to support cognitive function. While I&apos;m not a medical expert, my goal is to share valuable information that encourages brain betterment.</p>
