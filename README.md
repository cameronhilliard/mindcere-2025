# MindCere - An informational brain health ETL Pipeline

# Link: https://www.mindcere.com

## Why did I make this?
I made this web application to explore the idea of brain health, from a seizure that I experienced in Early Febuary 2025. 
The goal of this application was to make it use AI to automatically populate information on a weekly basis through an ETL Pipeline. 

# What Tools I Used.
- FastAPI Built backend. 
- MongoDB Atlas to host database. 
- AWS EC2 to host backend.
- Open AI API to grab content for database.
- Apache Airflow for ETL Pipeline Automation.
